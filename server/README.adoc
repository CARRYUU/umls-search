== Getting Started

To get started with UMLS Search Boot, follow the steps below:

. Download MetaMapLite:
* Visit the https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/ii/tools/MetaMap/run-locally/MetaMapLite.html[NLM MetaMapLite] page.
* Download `2022AB UMLS Level 0+4+9 DataSet` zip file.
* Extract the zip file.
* Locate the `metamaplite-_<version>_-standalone.jar` at `target` directory.
* Install MetaMapLite jar to local Maven repository.
+
[source, console]
----
# windows powershellË´ãÊää\ÊèõÊàê`ÊàñÁßªÈô§\‰∏¶ÂØ´Êàê‰∏ÄË°å
mvnw install:install-file \
    -Dfile=<path to metamaplite-version-standalone.jar> \
    -DgroupId=gov.nih.nlm.nls \
    -DartifactId=metamaplite \
    -Dversion=<version> \
    -Dpackaging=jar \
    -DgeneratePom=true
----

* Configure MetaMapLite directory:
** Locate the `src/main/resources/.env` file.
** Set the `MMLITE_DIR` variable to the path that contains the `public_mm_lite` directory. For example, `/home/user/metamaplite`. 
   
. Set up Environment Variables:
* Locate the `src/main/resources/.env` file.
* Review the provided `.env.example` file for detailed instructions on setting up the required environment variables.
* Make sure to configure the environment variables correctly based on your specific setup.

. Run the Application:
* Open a terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the project root directory.
* Execute the following command:
+
[source, console]
----
mvn spring-boot:run
----
* This command will start the application listening on http://localhost:8080 , your can change the port at .env file or application.properties.

== Testing

To test UMLS Search Boot, you have two options:

. Using IntelliJ IDEA:
* Open IntelliJ IDEA.
* Navigate to the `src/test/java` directory.
* Right-click on the directory and select "Run 'All Tests'".
* IntelliJ IDEA will execute all the tests and display the results.

. Using Maven:
* Open a terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the project root directory.
* Execute the following command:
+
[source, console]
----
mvn test
----
* Maven will run all the tests in the project and provide the test results.

== Build

Build jar file
[source, console]
----
mvn install \
  -Pci \ <1>
  -Ddir=<output directory> \ <2>
  -DfinalName=server 
----
<1> Use profile called `ci`, see https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html
<2> Without this line, it would export to `umls-search/server/target`

== Deployment

. Create service file.
+
[%linenums,text]
----
# At /home/umlssearch/.config/systemd/user/umls-search.service

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----
<1> You can configure .env file here.
<1> Or you can change file path as your built jar path.
<3> See https://www.baeldung.com/linux/run-java-application-as-service.

. Place `metamaplite` folder into `/home/umlssearch/`.
. Run `loginctl enable-linger umlssearch`, more information see https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd/User#Automatic_start-up_of_systemd_user_instances
. Run `systemctl --user daemon-reload`
. At `/home/umlssearch/.config/systemd/user/`, Run `systemctl --user enable --now umls-search`
