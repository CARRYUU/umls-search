# UMLS Search Boot üçÉü•æ

## Getting Started

To get started with UMLS Search Boot, follow the steps below:

1. Download MetaMapLite:
   - Visit the [NLM MetaMapLite](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/ii/tools/MetaMap/run-locally/MetaMapLite.html) page.
   - Download `2022AB UMLS Level 0+4+9 DataSet` zip file.
   - Extract the zip file.
   - Locate the `metamaplite-<version>-standalone.jar` at `target` directory.
   - Install MetaMapLite jar to local Maven repository.
        ```shell
        # windows powershellË´ãÊää\ÊèõÊàê`ÊàñÁßªÈô§\‰∏¶ÂØ´Êàê‰∏ÄË°å
        mvnw install:install-file \
            -Dfile=<path to metamaplite-version-standalone.jar> \
            -DgroupId=gov.nih.nlm.nls \
            -DartifactId=metamaplite \
            -Dversion=<version> \
            -Dpackaging=jar \
            -DgeneratePom=true
        ```
   - Configure MetaMapLite directory:
       - Locate the `src/main/resources/.env` file.
       - Set the `MMLITE_DIR` variable to the path that contains the `public_mm_lite` directory. For example, `/home/user/metamaplite`. 
   
2. Set up Environment Variables:
   - Locate the `src/main/resources/.env` file.
   - Review the provided `.env.example` file for detailed instructions on setting up the required environment variables.
   - Make sure to configure the environment variables correctly based on your specific setup.

3. Run the Application:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project root directory.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```sh
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```
   - This command will start the application listening on http://localhost:8080 , your can change the port at .env file or application.properties.

## Testing

To test UMLS Search Boot, you have two options:

1. Using IntelliJ IDEA:
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Navigate to the `src/test/java` directory.
   - Right-click on the directory and select "Run 'All Tests'".
   - IntelliJ IDEA will execute all the tests and display the results.

2. Using Maven:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project root directory.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```sh
     mvn test
     ```
   - Maven will run all the tests in the project and provide the test results.

It is usually caused by a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/bloodclots.html\">blood clot</a> that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This keeps blood from flowing to the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Another cause is stenosis, or narrowing of the artery.
